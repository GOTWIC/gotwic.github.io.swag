        <h1>Hacking into Warframe's Communication Servers</h1>
        <p> 
          Warframe is a free-to-play space-themed third-person shooter developed by Digital Extremes, with millions of players across the globe. 
          Not only is the game one of the most popular games ever created - consistently being in the top 30 active players for the past decade - but also my most played game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back when I used to code for fun, I'd often write c++ scripts to create tools for various things in my life such as music and chess, and Warframe was no exception.
          The habit persisted and eventually my suite of tools grew into excel damage calculators, java script discord bots, and python scripts for in-game image processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it comes to no surprise that when I heard a rumor a few months ago that there was a vulnerability in Warframe's authentication process, I was instantly intruiged.
          Access into Warframe's communication server would allow for the creation of trading bot faster than any other bot on the market. 
          In the past few years, multiple bots have been developed by various players (including me), but lack of internal access has made the bots limited and laggy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such an exploit would not affect gameplay, nor 99.99% of the player base. 
          However, a bot with instant access to the server would provide a handful of players a trading edge over the ~200 or so players that trade high value items (often worth thousands of dollars) on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the only person who knew about the vulnerability was a supposed 17-year old Russian hacker by the name Redlim, who was unwilling to share the details with anyone. 
          This was expected as he was making a fortune charging $100/month for access to his bot.
